    Yoga is a natural way which is helpful to remove or overcome these deep rooted worries and fears. It is A mind - body connection. Yoga includes asana, breathing techniques and pranayama, meditation and relaxation techniques, used to counter the effects of stress and anxiety and is cost-effective and easy to implement. If a person is having a long term history of anxiety disorder or if it is severe, then it is better to go for a counselling first and then later to continue with the therapy.

A few asanas like Vrikshasana, Tadasana, Vajrasana, Shashankasana, Shavasana, Uttanpadasana, Makarasana coupled with pranayama like anulom- vilom, on a regular basis, helps to flush out all the negative thoughts and tiredness of the minds.
Observe how deep your inhalation and exhalation is. Hold your breath for a few seconds after exhalation. If the negative thoughts are again disturbing, then open the eyes and feel the abdominal and chest movements while breathing. Repeat the same which helps to reduce the continuous thoughts of the mind.
Relaxation techniques such as deep relaxation techniques and yoga nidra are very beneficial in anxiety disorders. Yoga nidra is qualitatively different from relaxation. It is a ‘sleep’ where all the burdens are thrown off to attain a more blissful state of awareness, a relaxation much more intense than ordinary sleep. Yoga Nidra aims to focus the mind to achieve relaxation and increase wellness.

During anxiety and depression, there is a decrease in neurotransmitters such as serotonin and norepinephrine. Besides, an increased level of cortisol has a role in causing depression by regulating the function of serotonin and norepinephrine. Yoga helps in decreasing the cortisol levels leading to a counter-regulatory effect to reduce the depressive and anxiety symptoms.

Meditation can be done for improving the concentration and to stabilize the mind. It has been proven to be a very good solution for stress management. This practice is a promising new treatment for stress related disorders. Meditation indicates a potential role in reducing maladaptive and compulsive behaviours. These techniques alter theta and alpha EEG patterns significantly more than regular relaxation.
Yoga is important in day to day life, not only for the people who have anxiety disorders, but to improve the overall health and quality of life. Regular practice of yoga helps to achieve peacefulness of body and mind.

“YOGA a secret of being healthy.”
